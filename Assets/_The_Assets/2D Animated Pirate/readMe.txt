Thank you for your purchase! 
We hope you are pleased with our product. 

ABOUT: 
All our character models come already prepared as prefabs which can simply be dropped into your scene. 
They also come with a set of animations. 
However you still have to assign controls or states to them, depending on the needs of your project. 
All animations were created using Unity so you can change and add to them however you like. 
The models are PNG based puppet rigs, so no additional packages are required to use them.
